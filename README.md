# Introduction

[SciSpark](http://esto.nasa.gov/forum/estf2015/presentations/Mattmann_S1P8_ESTF2015.pdf) is a scalable scientific processing platform that makes interactive computation and exploration possible. This prototype project outlines the architecture of the scientific RDD (SRDD), and a library of linear algebra and geospatial operations. Its initial focus is expressing [Grab em' Tag em' Graph em' algorithm](https://github.com/kwhitehall/grab-tag-graph) as a map-reduce algorithm. 

# Installation

The full installation procedure for SciSpark can be found [here](https://github.com/SciSpark/SciSpark/wiki/2.-Installation).


# Getting Started

The steps to getting started with a simple SciSpark example can be found [here](https://github.com/SciSpark/SciSpark/wiki/3.-Getting-Started).

# Running the test

The steps to running the SciSpark test suite can be found [here](https://github.com/SciSpark/SciSpark/wiki/4.-Running-the-Tests).

# API
SciSpark documentation can be found at https://scispark.jpl.nasa.gov/api/

# SciSpark notebooks
SciSpark frontend interface leverages notebook software and is built on Apache Zeppelin. Examples of notebooks leveraging the SciSpark API and furnished with visualizations of the data analyzed can be found [here](https://github.com/SciSpark/scispark_zeppelin_notebooks).

# Grab em' Tag em' Graph em' : An Automated Search for Mesoscale Convective Complexes

The initial application of SciSpark is to scale the Grab em' Tag em' Graph em' algorithm.
More about GTG can be found [here](https://github.com/SciSpark/SciSpark/wiki/5.-Grab-em'-Tag-em'-Graph-em').
